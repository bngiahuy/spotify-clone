# Search top tracks by artist

> using Spotify API

This is the first project I've worked with API ever. With some help from _Youtube_ video (*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PWDxgqLmDA*) and _Spotify for Developers_ page, I have created a small project based on this video.

## Usage

Clone this github to your machine. Then go inside the `.env` file at the root folder and add your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Spotify Dashboard. For more information, visit this link: *https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api*.

Then run these two commands from terminal:
`npm install`
`npm start`
